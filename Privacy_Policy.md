## How We Use Information

Since we don't collect any information, we have nothing to use, sell, or share.

### What Happens on Your Device

All game logic, AI processing, and data storage happens **locally on your device**:

1. **Gameplay:** All calculations performed on-device
2. **AI Opponent:** Runs locally using Swift code
3. **Save/Load:** Stored in app's local storage
4. **Settings:** Saved to device preferences

### No Data Transmission

**ApPolForgeSym does not transmit any data** to our servers because we don't have any servers. The app works entirely offline.

**Exception:** If you choose to enable optional AI features (see "Third-Party Services" below).

---

## Third-Party Services

### Optional AI Integration (OpenAI / Anthropic Claude)

ApPolForgeSym includes **optional** integration with external AI services for enhanced strategic recommendations. This feature is:

- ⚠️ **Entirely optional** - Not required to play the game
- ⚠️ **User-initiated** - Only activated if you add your own API key
- ⚠️ **Your account** - Uses your personal OpenAI/Anthropic account
- ⚠️ **Your responsibility** - Subject to those services' privacy policies

**How It Works:**
1. You create an account with OpenAI or Anthropic (optional)
2. You obtain an API key from their service
3. You enter that API key in ApPolForgeSym settings
4. API key is stored securely in iOS Keychain (encrypted, device-only)
5. When you request AI advice, the app sends game state data to the AI service
6. The AI service processes your request and returns recommendations
7. You are billed by OpenAI/Anthropic according to their pricing

**Data Shared with AI Services (when you use this feature):**
- Game state (current week, polling numbers, funds, state data)
- Your campaign actions and history
- Nothing personally identifiable (no name, email, device ID)

**Important Notes:**
- We don't receive, store, or have access to this data
- The AI service may log requests per their privacy policy
- Review [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy) and [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- You can remove API keys at any time
- Game fully functional without this feature

### Apple Services

ApPolForgeSym uses standard Apple platform features:

- **iOS Keychain** - Secure storage for optional API keys (device-only, encrypted)
- **UserDefaults** - Local storage for settings (device-only)
- **File System** - Local storage for game saves (device-only)
- **Haptic Engine** - Vibration feedback (no data collected)

These are standard iOS APIs that don't transmit data to Apple or third parties.

### No Other Third Parties

We do **NOT** use:
- ❌ Analytics services (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- ❌ Advertising networks (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.)
- ❌ Social media SDKs (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- ❌ Crash reporting services (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)
- ❌ Cloud storage services (iCloud, Dropbox, etc.)
- ❌ Payment processors (no in-app purchases)

## Data Security

### Local Data Protection

Your data is protected by:

1. **iOS Sandbox** - App can only access its own files
2. **iOS Keychain** - API keys encrypted with hardware-backed encryption
3. **No network transmission** - Data never leaves your device (except optional AI)
4. **No cloud backup** - Game saves not backed up to iCloud (you control backups)

### Best Practices

If you use optional AI features:
- Use a dedicated API key (not your main account)
- Monitor API usage in OpenAI/Anthropic dashboard
- Revoke API key if device is lost or stolen
- Review AI service's security practices
